C# is a cross-platform general purpose language that makes developers productive while 
writing highly performant code. With millions of developers, C# is the most popular .NET 
language. C# has broad support in the ecosystem and all .NET workloads. Based on object-oriented 
principles, it incorporates many features from other paradigms, not least functional programming. 
Low-level features support high-efficiency scenarios without writing unsafe code. Most of the .NET 
runtime and libraries are written in C#, and advances in C# often benefit all .NET developers.
